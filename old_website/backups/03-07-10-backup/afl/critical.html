<H3>Have a project due for class?</H3>  
<hr>
These are some interesting ideas to explore:<p>

<OL>
	<LI>Analyze the story problems in a math book used at your school.  
	What activities are women and girls,  men and boys, engaged in?  
	Draw conclusions and present them to your class.<p>

	<LI>Prepare a talk about a woman famous in a math or science-
	related field.  Emphasize any obstacles (including those related to 
	sex) this woman had to overcome in order to reach her position of 
	leadership or personal success.  If she faced no serious obstacles, 
	how do you account for this?  Mention her family¹s attitudes toward 
	her career, along with problems of special strengths she may have 
	had.<p>

	<LI>Analyze the content of a science textbook used at your school.  
	Tally the number of girls shown participating in science activities 
	versus the number of boys.  Does one sex seem to be ²doing² while 
	the other sex is ²watching²?  Is there a marked difference in the 
	kinds of activities girls are shown doing versus those boys are shown 
	doing?  Tally the number of male teachers in illustrations versus 
	female teachers.  Also look at biographical information about 
	scientists, past and present.  How many of these practicing scientists 
	are men?  How many are women?  Analyze your findings and draw 
	some conclusions.<p>
