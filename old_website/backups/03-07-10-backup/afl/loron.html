<H4>Project Description</H4>
Welcome to the Women and Science page of the world wide web.  
As part of a final project for a Women's Studies course at the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison, we chose to explore the reasons 
why women are less likely to enter professions in math and science, 
and we would like to act as ²student voices² to let you know how 
beneficial it would be for society and the continuous advancement 
of women if more women were involved in these the sciences.<p>

Girls say they enjoy math in earlier grades, but tend to shy away in 
adolescence.  However, as many girls as boys now take advanced 
math classes in high school and major in math almost as often in 
college.  A the graduate level, however, the number of women 
entering math programs drops off significantly.  According to the 
Department of Education, just 21 percent of math doctorates and 39 
percent of master¹s degrees went to women in 1992 (US News and 
World Report, 11/7/94)  The change doesn¹t occur in graduate 
school, though.  During the elementary years, females tend to be 
praised for their neat handwriting and appearance of assignments 
while boys are judged more on the actual content.  It has also been 
discovered that girls think more about what they say in class; 
therefore, it takes them a longer amount of time to raise their hand 
in response to a question.  Boys tend to speak as they think, which 
explains teachers quick recognition of male students.  This forces 
girls to refrain from answering, and begins the trend that leads to 
less interest in math and science.<p>

Do you find this in your classrooms?  Do your teachers treat male 
and female students differently?  There are many things that you, 
your parent(s), teachers, and administrators can do.
One alternative, segregation, has been a hot topic recently.  
Segregation involves constructing separate math and science classes 
for males and females so hat both sexes feel comfortable in the 
classroom setting.  Girls in exclusive math and science classes have 
been shown to achieve higher scores in tests and enjoy these 
subjects more.  Would being in a sex-segregated learning 
environment increase your participation in a science class?<p>
