<h3> Women's Career Sources on the Web</H3> 

<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://bunny.cs.uiuc.edu/funding/academicCareers.html">AGMOD'S collection of information on academic careers and academic life</a><br>
 Information on how to succeed in an academic career, taken from the Workshop on Academic Careers for Women, held at the FCRC conference in May 1993. This is an excellent source of information and advice for anyone just starting out in academia in computer science. <p>

<li><A HREF="http://www.ksu.edu/~dangle/">Kansas Mentor Project </a><br>
We will use this site for career, educational and related resources for women (especially as it relates to non-traditional careers). Our intent is to continually build this resource -- so we are always "under construction."<p>

<li><A HREF="http://xerxes.nas.edu:70/1/cwse">Organizations Encouraging Women in Science and Engineering</a><br>
Established by the National Research Council within the Office of Scientific and
Engineering Personnel in 1990, the committee is responsible for activities aimed at
increasing the entry and retention of talented women into scientific and engineering careers.<p>

<li><A HREF="http://web.fie.com/web/fed/onr/prog/onrpgadm.htm">Women Science Scholars Program</a><br>
The Women Science Scholars program at the Mary Ingraham Bunting Institute of
Radcliffe College encourages the research and teaching careers of women in
science and engineering who are at critical career points by providing
postdoctoral opportunities in an academic research setting.  <p>
