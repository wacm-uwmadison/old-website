<h1>Degrees of a Circle</h1>

<p>Every circle has 360 degrees. So, to have Logo turn all the way
around, and end up facing the same way he started, you type
<code>goto turnright, degrees = 360</code> or <code>goto turnleft,
degrees = 360</code>. But this will make Logo very dizzy. To have
him turn less than completely around, use a number that is less
than 360.</p>

<p>The picture below shows you the instructions you should use to
make Logo turn around. Remember, the instructions are
<em>relative</em> to the way Logo is currently facing. So, if Logo
is facing toward the top of the screen, then the instruction
<code>goto turnleft, degrees = 90</code> will tell Logo to face
left. But if Logo is already facing to the left, that instruction
will tell Logo to turn so that he is facing the bottom of the
screen. If you want Logo to turn less than 90 degrees but more than
45 degrees just use a number in between 45 and 90.</p>
