<h1>Exploring Computer Programming</h1>

<h2>You Can Program</h2>
</center>

<p>Today you are going to learn how to program! There are many
programming tools out there; perhaps you have heard of some: Java,
Pascal, C++, Pizza, Perl, Logo,... A programming language lets you
talk with the computer. In many ways it is just like sending an
e-mail to one of your friends. In an e-mail, you type your message
in a language (perhaps english or spanish) that both you and your
friend understand. When you talk with the computer, you need to use
a language that the computer can understand.</p>

<h2>Moving Turtles</h2>
</center>

<p>Logo is a great programming language to introduce you to the
wonderful world of programming! In the Logo world you will direct a
turtle to move as you wish. Click on the turtle icon on your
desktop to start the Logo application. Then follow the instructions
found at the <a href="./tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2>More About Logo</h2>
</center>

<p>Here are two great sites where you can go to learn more about
Logo.</p>

<p>The first site: <a href=
"http://library.thinkquest.org/18446/">Logo (http://library.thinkquest.org/18446/)</a> allows you to
program in Logo online. It also has a more complete tutorial and
lots of procedures that other students have written. It's a little
old, though, so some of the links don't work. In case you want to
use the procedures that we've written for you, we've put a link to
them <a href="./procedures.txt">right here</a>.</p>

<p>The second site: <a href=
"http://education.mit.edu/starlogo/">StarLogo (http://education.mit.edu/starlogo/)</a> is about a
program that allows you to control as many turtles as you want all
at once. This site is really up to date. If you have a computer at
home, you can go ahead and download the program so you can run it
at home whenever you want. To use StarLogo first click on the
<em>Download</em> link to download the application, then click on
the <em>Getting Started</em> link and follow the instructions to
learn how to make your turtles move. StarLogo is <em>much</em> more
powerful than Logo but it also has a slightly different syntax and
rules that you will have to learn. As a bonus, there are lots of
already written programs that you can run from the StarLogo
application.</p>

<h2>The Parts of the Computer</h2>
</center>

<p>We've spent all this time on software, now it's time to take a
look at the computer itself.<br>
<a href="./Hardware/index.html">Virtual tour of a modern day computer. (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~deppeler/eyh/f04/Hardware)</a>

<h2>Later On</h2>
</center>

<p>Please send us any Logo procedures that you write so we can post
them here. Send an email to mulhern (mulhern@cs.wisc.edu) with your
procedure and an explanation of what it does and she'll go ahead
and post it.</p>

<p>Also, we plan to update the Logo Application that you ran today,
so that the bugs are fixed and so that you can download it and run
it at home. Alas, we're all kind of busy, so that's not going to
happen too soon.</p>

<p>Tell your friends about this site so that they can check out
Logo as well.</p>
