<center><h1>Exploring Computer Programming</h1>
Saturday, October 30th, 2004.</center>

<center><h2>You Can Program</h2></center>
Today you are going to learn how to program! There are many programming tools out there; 
perhaps you have heard of some: Java, Pascal, C++, Pizza, Perl, Logo,... A programming language lets 
you talk with the computer. In many ways it is just like sending an e-mail to one of your friends. 
In an e-mail, you type your message in a language (perhaps english or spanish) that both you 
and your friend understand. When you talk with the computer, you need to use a language that 
the computer can understand. To learn these computer words for Logo, go to

<Center><h2> Moving Turtles </h2></center>

Logo is a great programming language to introduce you to the wonderful world of programming! 
In the Logo world you will direct a turtle to move as you wish. We will be following the 
instructions found at the <a href="">tutorial</a> for Saturday's class. If you would like to 
download your own copy 
of Logo to use at home, you need to go to <a 
href="http://library.thinkquest.org/18446/eindex.shtml">http://library.thinkquest.org/18446/eindex.shtml</a> 
and click on the Download link.  If you would like to program online (no downloading 
necessary), just go to the same site above and click on Program. 
<br><br>
If you would like to direct more than one turtle, then StarLogo is the programming language 
for you. To install StarLogo on your own computer, 
you need to go to 
<a href="http://education.mit.edu/starlogo/">http://education.mit.edu/starlogo/</a> and click on "Download."
Now just follow the instructions and you will have your own copy of StarLogo to use at home.
