<h1>Logo Tutorial</h1>

<h3>Telling Logo Where To Go</h3>

<p>Getting Logo to move around is easy, just tell him where to go
and he'll do it. Logo always looks in a special place for
instructions. That place is the first line inside the <em>main</em>
procedure. Press the <em>Load Code</em> button to load the code
provided for you into the pane on the right side of your Logo
Application window. At the top of your screen you'll see this:</p>

<pre>
    <code>procedure main
    end</code>  
</pre>

<p>Put the instructions you want Logo to follow below
<code>procedure main</code> and above <code>end</code>.</p>

<p>To get started, you'll need just three simple instructions. The
first instruction, <code>go</code>, is your way of telling Logo
to walk forward in the direction he's facing. To get Logo to walk
forward 50 steps, type <code>go 50</code>. Remember
to type this <em>inside</em> the main procedure. Press the
<em>draw</em> button and watch Logo walk forward 50 steps.</p>

<p>The other two instructions, <code>rt</code> and
<code>lt</code> tell Logo which way to turn and how much. For
example, to make Logo turn right 90 degrees, type <code>rt 90</code>.
If you don't remember how degrees work, take a look at this 
<a href="./degrees.html">explanation</a>.</p>

<h3>The Maze</h3>

<p>Your first challenge is to get Logo out of the maze. Use the
<em>Load Maze</em> button on your LogoApplication to draw the maze.
Now use the instructions you just learned, <code>go</code>,
<code>rt</code>, and <code>lt</code> to get Logo out
of the maze. Let us know if you need help or hints.</p>

<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>Logo moves so fast that you really can't see him move, you can 
only tell where he's been by the line he draws as he moves.
To slow Logo down enough that you can see him moving, we wrote
a <em>procedure</em>, <code>logo</code>. It is one of the procedures 
that was loaded when you pressed the <em>Load Code</em> button.
You can use <code>logo</code> instead of <code>go</code> to tell
Logo to move slowly. To tell Logo to take 50 steps, <em>slowly</em>,
type <code>goto logo, steps = 50</code>. Unfortunately, on some 
of your computers the screen will flicker a lot when Logo moves 
slowly. What can we say, animation is tricky.</p>
   

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Some of you may have experienced problems by now. If you forgot
to put your instructions inside the main procedure then you 
got an error. Also, every computer language requires you to follow
very precise rules when writing instructions. These rules are known
as the <em>syntax</em> of the language. If you do not follow these
rules <em>precisely</em> Logo will not be able to underestand your
instructions.</p>

<p>So far, you've used four Logo commands. The first three commands,
<code>go</code>, <code>rt</code> and <code>lt</code>
just tell Logo how to move. The fourth, <code>goto</code>, allows
you to call a procedure.</p>

<h4>Calling Procedures</h4>

<p>The syntax for calling procedures is:</p>

<code>goto</code> <var>procedure name</var><code>,</code>
<var>parameter</var> <code>=</code> <var>value</var> 

<p>In <code>goto logo, steps = 50</code></p>

<ul>
<li><var>procedure name</var> is <code>logo</code></li>

<li><var>parameter</var> is <code>steps</code></li>

<li><var>value</var> is <code>50</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some procedures have no parameters, so the syntax for calling
them is just:</p>

<code>goto</code> <var>procedure name</var> 

<p>Other procedures have two parameters, and the syntax for calling
them is:</p>

<code>goto</code> <var>procedure name</var><code>,</code>
<var>parameter1</var> <code>=</code>
<var>value1</var><code>,</code> <var>parameter2</var>
<code>=</code> <var>value2</var> 

<p>Can you figure out what the syntax for calling a procedure that
has three parameters would be?</p>

<h3>Write Your Own Procedure</h3>

<p>You can make procedures of your own if you want. The syntax for
any procedure is the same as that for the main procedure:</p>

<pre>
<code>procedure</code> <var>procedure name</var>
  <var>procedure body</var>
<code>end</code>
</pre>

<p>In the main procedure you just wrote,</p>

<ul>
<li><var>procedure name</var> is <code>main</code></li>

<li><var>procedure body</var> is the code you wrote to get Logo out
of the maze</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not call your procedure <code>main</code>; <code>main</code>
is a special word reserved for the main procedure.</p>

<p>Try writing a procedure to draw a simple shape: a square or a
triangle or a rectangle. This is an example of a procedure to draw
a pentagon (a five-sided figure).</p>

<pre>
<code>procedure pentagon
    goto logo, steps = 50
    rt 360/5
    goto logo, steps = 50
    rt 360/5
    goto logo, steps = 50
    rt 360/5
    goto logo, steps = 50
    rt 360/5
    goto logo, steps = 50
    rt 360/5
end
</code>
</pre>

<p>Notice that Logo can do simple math; instead of bothering to
calculate 360/5 for myself, I let Logo do it.Also, I used the 
<code>logo</code> procedure because I wanted Logo to move slowly. 
If you want Logo to move rapidly, use the <code>go</code> command instead.
Go ahead and call your
procedure inside your <em>main</em> method. Use the
<em>Clear</em> button to get rid of the maze.</p>

<h3>Parameterize Your Procedure</h3>

<p>The <em>pentagon</em> procedure is nice, but it could be better.
Right now, it only makes one size of pentagon, one where Logo
takes 50 steps on each side. If I make the number of steps that
Logo takes a parameter of the procedure, then I can use the same
procedure to draw pentagons of any size.</p>

<pre>
  
<code>procedure pentagon
    goto logo, steps = side
    rt 360/5
    goto logo, steps = side
    rt 360/5
    goto logo, steps = side
    rt 360/5
    goto logo, steps = side
    rt 360/5
    goto logo, steps = side
    rt 360/5
end
</code>  
  
 
</pre>

<p>The new procedure uses the variable, <code>side</code> for the
number of steps, instead of the number 50. Now, if I want Logo to
draw a really small pentagon, I call <code>pentagon</code> like
this: <code>goto pentagon, side = 10</code>. If I want Logo to draw
a really large pentagon, I call <code>pentagon</code> like this:
<code>goto pentagon, side=200</code>. Of course, if Logo tries do
draw a pentagon that big, he might walk right off the drawing
space. Can you parameterize your procedure in the same way?</p>

<h3>More Logo Instructions</h3>

<p>Logo <em>commands</em> are the fundamental building blocks of
the Logo language. So far, you've used just four commands, 
<code>go</code>, <code>rt</code>, and <code>lt</code> and the
<code>goto</code> command for calling a procedure. Press the
<em>Logo Syntax</em> button in LogoApplication to see the other
commands you can use.</p>

<p>The <code>repeat</code>
command is very powerful. 
You can use this command to call a procedure many times.
These two procedures use <code>repeat</code> to draw a spiral. 
These procedures were also loaded when you pressed the <em>Load Code</em>
button. Try calling <code>spiral</code> from your main procedure. 
Feel free to change <code>spiral</code> or <code>spiralhelper</code> 
and see how that changes what Logo does.</p>

<pre>
  <code>procedure spiralhelper
    goto logo, steps = loop
    rt 50
  end

  procedure spiral
    repeat 100, spiralhelper
  end
</code>  
 
</pre>

<h3>Finishing Up</h3>

<p>Do you want to save a procedure you wrote so you can use it
later? To do that, open the <em>Notepad</em> application on your
computer, copy the procedure into a Notepad document, and save it
to the <tt>EYH</tt> folder on your Desktop.  Name the file <tt>your_name_here.logo</tt>.
We'll post your procedure on the
main page so that you can access it anytime you want.</p>
