<h2>WACM Mentoring Program Kick Off Dinner with Glass Nickel Pizza! 3-4-10</h2>
<p>All mentees have been assigned to a mentor. Now its time to gather and get introduced to each other! Mentors and Mentees
gathered at this event and got to know each other and other WACM members. Mary Vernon, Susan Horwitz, and Shan Lu were also
present as female professors of the CS department.</p>

<p>Mary Vernon, the CS chair, indicated that we not only want to
tell female students about a Computer Science major life in school, but also want to make them aware of great 
opportunites that they will have after graduating with this major. She introduced, Shan Lu, the most recently hired female
faculty memeber, and that she is a great resource to ask questions about life as a graduate and undergraduate student. Shan also
emphasized that even though she is very busy, she is willing to provide advice to students interested in Computer Sciences.</p>

<p>There is no deadline for signing up for the mentoring program. If you are interested E-mail Elizabeth Soechting, the 
WACM president, to be matched with a mentor.</p>

<h2>WACM Visits the Madison Microsoft Office 2-26-10</h2>
<p>A group of WACM members walked to the Madison Microsoft office at 551 West Main Street. 
We got to meet David Dewitt, and other Database professors along with Research assistants and lab employees. The lab's
focus is in Databases and is associated with the SQL department of Microsoft.</p>

<h2>WACM Lunch/ Mentoring Program 2-2-10</h2>

<p>Barbara Liskov from MIT is the winner of Turing award in 2009. She was visiting UW-Madison for a talk and we were opportunate
to meet with her. We discussed issues regarding to the 302 course which is the gateway to Computer Sciences for students. 
These are some of the ideas that we talked about:
<li>Decreasing the number of students in large lectures so that students can have better contact with the professors.</li>
<li>Programming Robots which has been used in some universities and is more fun.</li>
