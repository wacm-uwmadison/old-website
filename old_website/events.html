Her team gathers IP from all around ARM (interconnect, DMCs, CPUs, and more) and stitches them into an SoC. This enables them to run performance evaluations and test suites to ensure the IPs work well together. Adam graduated from UW - Madison with degrees in ECE and CS in 2014, and an MS in CS in 2016. After two internships with ARM in 2013 and 2014, he started full time last June. He currently makes use of fast model simulators and emulators doing full system validation using operating systems. In the past, he has worked on both verification and RTL design for Cortex A57 and A72.
