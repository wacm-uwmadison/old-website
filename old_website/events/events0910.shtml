present as female professors of the CS department.</p>

<p>Mary Vernon, the CS chair, indicated that we not only want to
tell female students about a Computer Science major life in school, but also want to make them aware of great 
opportunites that they will have after graduating with this major. She introduced, Shan Lu, the most recently hired female
faculty memeber, and that she is a great resource to ask questions about life as a graduate and undergraduate student. Shan also
emphasized that even though she is very busy, she is willing to provide advice to students interested in Computer Sciences.</p>
