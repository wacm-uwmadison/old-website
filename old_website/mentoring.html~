                <p>The WACM Mentoring Program was started in the spring semester of 2010. We are currently
                accepting new students interested in both mentoring and having a mentor. If you sign up to have
                a mentor, you will be paired with a CS graduate student mentor. Your mentor will be a friendly
                person to consult for computer science information (e.g. opportunities in CS, various sub-fields
                of CS, industry vs. graduate school, etc) and help you build a network of peers in computer
                science. You will be invited to WACM mentoring events to help you to meet other women in the
                CS department, learn about CS, and of course, have fun!</p>

                <p>To find your mentor contact the
                <a href="officers.html">Mentoring Chair</a>.</p>
