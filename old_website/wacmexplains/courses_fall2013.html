<h3>WACM Guide to Undergrad Courses, Fall 2013</h3>
<p>Looking for information about which classes are interesting to take this fall?  Getting frustrated by the dry official descriptions, which may be out of date and/or mean nothing to you until you've already taken the class?</p>
<p>To help students make educated decisions about which courses to take, we've put together this list of all courses offered in the fall.  We'll include the official description, but we also asked the instructor for each course what they thought was the coolest thing that students will learn.  Knowing what your professor thinks is cool can help narrow down which courses might interest you. We also asked them what a well-prepared student should know before taking the class, because sometimes they expect you to already be familiar with things none of the prereqs covered.  While it is completely possible to learn these things and do well in the course, it's good to know beforehand so you can prepare (and so you don't inadvertently take multiple classes which require you to spend a lot of time learning new languages or concepts!).</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that this was put together by WACM (specifically, <a href="/~lena/">Lena</a>, a grad student).  We don't intend for this to replace common sense, consultations with the <a href="">Undergrad Advising Committee</a>, or any information in any handbook.  Especially about requirements.  However, we have run talked to ugac and we have made every effort to be accurate!</p>

<p>A few general pieces of information: some courses vary depending on the instructor.  You might want to check <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/academic-programs/courses">instructor evaluations</a> from previous semesters, or <a href="http://registrar.wisc.edu/course_grade_distributions.htm">the course grade distribution</a> from the previous time an instructor taught a course.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are the courses:</p>


<ul>

<li><ul>
<li><strong>CS 240: Introduction to Discrete Mathematics</strong></li>
<li><a href="">Shi Jin</a></li>
<li>TR 9:30 + Discussion</li>
<li>3 cr.</li>
<li><strong>Official description</strong>: Basic concepts of mathematics (definitions, proofs, sets, functions, and relations) with a focus on discrete structures: integers, bits, strings, trees, and graphs. Propositional logic, Boolean algebra, and predicate logic. Mathematical induction and recursion. Invariants and algorithmic correctness. Recurrences and asymptotic growth analysis. Fundamentals of counting. Prereq: Math 221.</li>
<li><strong>Coolest thing</strong>: "That there is useful math that isn't calculus.  My personal favorite is the RSA cryptographic system, which is based on number theory and efficient ways of doing arithmetic." -- Eric Bach</li>
<li><strong>What to know</strong>: "One semester of calculus, things like the definition of a limit and how sums relate to integrals.  A mastery of high school algebra is a must.  Computer skills can come in handy for checking your work, even if they aren't required for anything we do." -- Eric Bach</li>
</ul></li>
<br />
<li><ul>
<li><strong>CS 252: Introduction To Computer Engineering</strong></li>
<li><a href="/~markhill/">Mark Hill</a></li>
<li>MWF 2:25</li>
<li>2 cr.</li>
<li><strong>Official description</strong>: Logic components built with transistors, rudimentary Boolean algebra, basic combinational logic design, basic synchronous sequential logic design, basic computer organization and design, introductory machine-and assembly-language programming.</li>
<li><strong>Coolest thing</strong>: "Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said, 'All computers do is fetch and shuffle numbers, but they do it fast enough that the results appear to be magic.' This course surveys this magic from transistors to low-level software. Think of 252 as computer engineering appreciation."</li>
<li><strong>What to know</strong>: "Students should have written a few small computer programs in any language."</li>
</ul></li>
<br />
<li><ul>
<li><strong>CS 302: Introduction To Programming</strong></li>
<li><a href="/~deppeler/">Deb Deppeler</a>, various grad students</li>
<li>Check student center</li>
<li>3 cr.</li>
<li><strong>Official description</strong>: Instruction and experience in the use of an object-oriented programming language. Program design; development of good programming style; preparation for other Computer Science courses. Prereq: Problem solving skills such as those acquired in a statistics, logic, or advanced high school algebra course; or consent of instructor. Open to Fr.</li>
<li><strong>Coolest thing</strong>: "The coolest thing CS302 students learn is new ways to express their creativity and problem-solving skills.  In CS302, problem solutions are expressed in program code written in a programming language (Java currently).  Writing solutions to problems in a programming language means that the solution can be interpreted and executed by a machine.  This can be challenging, but it's also a thrill to see your program run on  your computer. Being able to interact with your program and know that your program does all of those things because of code that you wrote, is very rewarding."</li>
<li><strong>What to know</strong>: "Well prepared students enjoy a challenge and will have good logic and problem solving skills.  Knowing, or wanting to learn, something about mathematical computation, logical deduction, and how to develop a formal solution algorithm (sequence of steps) will also help anyone learning to program."</li>
</ul></li>

Prereq: CS 252 or equivalent. Not open to students with EGR classification.</li>
<li><strong>Coolest thing</strong>: "I would say the coolest thing that students get to learn about ECE352 is to understand the basics of how microprocessors are designed.  It helps them see how we build complex integrated circuits from a few fundamental concepts and building blocks. Using this information, students can take follow on classes on how to use and design microprocessors." -- Joe Krachey; "How to design and build the machines that run the world." -- Michael Morrow</li>
<li><strong>What to know</strong>: "A well prepared student should have a background in number systems (radix), a basic understanding of 2's compliment addition/subtractions, and basic binary logic gates." -- Joe Krachey; "Good fundamentals from ECE 252 - especially number representations and binary arithmetic." -- Michael Morrow</li>

level, the blueprint of a cell is specified by it's DNA sequence: a  four letter string of As, Ts, Gs, and Cs. The DNA code is read and interpreted
by networks of genes and proteins that make up a cell and enable cells to achieve specific tasks. Today we are able to measure different
aspects of living cells, but putting it all together to build a picture of how cells function requires us to address numerous computational problems.
In particular, students will learn about a range of string and graph-based algorithms (e.g. comparing the sequence of organisms) as well as machine learning approaches
 including markov models, clustering and probabilistic networks to address some of these problems. "</li>
<li><strong>What to know</strong>: "Some background in data structure (intro to data structures and algorithms),  computational complexity and statistics would be useful. Students must know how
to write code to implement some of the algorithms.  Languages that students use are typically C/C++, Java, Python. No background in biology
is required, students just need to have an interest in learning about the biology."</li>
