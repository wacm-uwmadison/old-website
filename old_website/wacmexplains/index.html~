                <h4>WACM Explains...Entrepreneurship</h4>

		<p>Come hear local entrepreneurs talk about their experiences going off
 the traditional paths and blazing through new territory to make their
 dreams come true. They'll discuss the challenges and rewards of
 starting a business.</p>

		<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Heather Wentler (Fractal / The Doyenne Group)
		<br /> Panelists:
		<br /> Forrest Woolworth (Capital Entrepreneurs / PerBlue)
		<br /> Jami Morton (SnowShoe)
		<br /> Betsy Rowbottom (The Good Jobs)
		<br /> Tim Kessler (Badger Innovations / Collegiate Entrepreneurs Org.)
		</p>
		<p> We will also include time for networking with the panelists after the talk.</p>

		<p>
		<i>When:</i> Wednesday, April 10 @ 6:00 pm<br />
		<i>Where:</i> CS 1221
		</p>

		<p>Full panelist bios:</p>
		<p><strong>Heather Wentler</strong> graduated from UW-Whitewater with an Elementary Education degree but after teaching in schools realized the traditional classroom setting wasn't meeting her or many of the students needs. She started a business called Fractal which provides S.T.E.A.M. enrichment programming for learners of all ages. Heather also organizes Madison SOUP which is a community focused micro-grant event, and is the co-founder of The Doyenne Group for women entrepreneurs looking for mentoring and networking.</p>
		<p><strong>Forrest Woolworth</strong>is a co-founder and the current director of Capital Entrepreneurs, a group dedicated to fostering entrepreneurship in the Madison area with over 200 member entrepreneurs. He is also an original team member and COO of PerBlue, a mobile and social gaming startup in Madison that now employs 30 people and entertains millions.  He previously worked for Cisco Systems and GE Healthcare, and graduated with a double major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
		<p><strong>Jami Morton</strong> is a scientist turned entrepreneur. She is the COO and co-founder of SnowShoe, a tech/hardware company that is building the authentication layer for the internet of things.  SnowShoe developed the SnowShoe Stamp, which is a simple, inexpensive hardware solution for authentication an app user is interacting with a real-world space, person, or embedded system.  Jami started SnowShoe while pursuing her Masters in Environment and Resources from UW Madison, she also holds a BS in Chemistry from Colorado School of Mines. </p>
		<p><strong>Betsy Rowbottom</strong> is a proud UW Alum.  She studied Communications with an emphasis on Radio, TV and Film.  After college, as much as Betsy loved Madison, bigger cities beckoned.  She moved to Chicago to join a Staffing and Recruiting film, then moved to Los Angeles when a job to represent commercial film directors was offered.  The daily 60+ minute commutes in LA grew tiresome so Betsy picked up and moved to Telluride, CO to work for the Telluride Film Festival.  Betsy has always followed her heart and passions above all else, so entrepreneurship was the next natural step.  She returned to her true home-base, Milwaukee, to start a business with longtime friend, Anne Nimke (who started a successful Recruitment Process Outsource company called Pinstripe).  Together, Anne and Betsy created The Good Jobs, a new employment solution to help companies to describe and leverage their culture to attract job seekers.  The Good Jobs launched on March 20th this year and currently has 20 customers --- and growing!</p>
		<p><strong>Tim Kessler</strong> is the president and co-founder of Badger Innovations, an entirely student run web development company focused on providing businesses with affordable websites while also giving students an opportunity to gain web design experience.   He is also the vice president of the Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization, a student group focused on providing an environment for students to discuss entrepreneurship and to learn about the opportunities available to them.  He will be graduating this Spring with a degree in History.</p>

                <h4>WACM Explains...Undergrad Course Offerings for Fall 2013 </h4>

                <p>It can be challenging to pick the most interesting courses from the official listings.</p>

                <p>We collected answers to "What is the coolest thing students
                will learn in your class?" from the professors, and we'll
                present the results at this session. We'll also cover major
                requirements, and let students ask questions and share
                information!</p>
                
                <p>We've compiled these answers here: <a href="courses_fall2013.html">WACM's
                    Fall 2013 Undergrad Course Info</a> (and our <a href="/wacm/docs/WACMExplains-CourseSelection-slides.pdf">slides</a>).</p>

                    Industry</h4> <p>Are you considering a career in the video
                game industry? Come meet Allison Salmon, a senior software
                engineer and veteran of the commercial game industry.  During

                <h4>WACM Explains...What comes next? Grad School or Industry?</h4>

                <p>What are the differences between grad school and
                industry, and the advantages and disadvantages of each.
                We will have several panelists who have experience with
                both grad school and industry, and we will try to
                provide a balanced look at the choices.</p>
